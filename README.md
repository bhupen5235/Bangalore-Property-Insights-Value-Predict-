# Banglore_property_analysis
 Improved README.md for Bangalore Property Price Prediction Project
This project aims to predict property prices in Bangalore by scraping data from the Makkan website, cleaning and extracting features from the data, and building machine learning models. The entire process is implemented using Python and various libraries, organized into separate Jupyter Notebook files for each major step.

Project Overview

The goal of this project is to predict property prices in Bangalore using machine learning models trained on data collected from the Makkan website. The project workflow involves four primary stages: data scraping, data cleaning, feature extraction, and model building. By dividing the tasks into separate steps, the project ensures a systematic approach to transforming raw web data into a predictive model capable of estimating property prices with high accuracy.

Data Collection (Data_scraping.ipynb)

Objective: Collect raw data on Bangalore properties directly from the Makkan website using web scraping techniques tailored for dynamic content.
Methodology:
Tool: Utilize Selenium for dynamic content handling.
Data Points: Extract details like bedrooms, bathrooms, location, price, and size.
Challenges Faced:
Dynamic Content Handling: Handled with Selenium for scrolling, clicking, and loading hidden data.
Data Integrity: Validated data against listings and handled timeouts/delays.
Output: Comprehensive CSV dataset containing scraped features.
Data Cleaning (cleaning.ipynb)

Objective: Refine the scraped data by addressing inconsistencies like missing values and duplicate entries.
Steps:
Missing Values: Handle missing values with imputation or removal strategies. Duplicate removal and data type normalization are also performed.
Outlier Detection: Identify and handle outliers in numeric fields using z-score analysis.
Output: Cleaned CSV dataset ready for further processing.
Feature Extraction (featureextraction.ipynb)

Objective: Extract additional features and categorize existing data.

Steps:

Bathroom Extraction: Develop a function to extract the number of bathrooms from the description.
Locality Standardization: Clean locality names for consistent entries.
Region Classification: (Replace with your approach if applicable)
Output: Enriched dataset with extracted features (e.g., number of bathrooms) saved as ML_ready.csv.

Model Building (ML_models.ipynb)

Objective: Develop and evaluate machine learning models for price prediction.
Models: (Consider including models you implemented)
Linear Regression
Decision Tree
Random Forest
Approach:
Data split (training/testing) for model evaluation and k-fold cross-validation for stability assessment.
Hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance.
Evaluation using Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared.
Output: The best performing model saved for potential deployment.
Tools & Libraries

Python: Core language for development.
Selenium: Web scraping for dynamic content. (Replaced Beautiful Soup)
Pandas & NumPy: Data manipulation and analysis.
Scikit-learn: Machine learning algorithms and evaluation metrics.
Matplotlib & Seaborn: Data visualization.
Jupyter Notebook: Interactive development environment.
Version Control: Git for tracking changes.
